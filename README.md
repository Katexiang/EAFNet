# EAFNet (Efficient Attention-bridged Fusion)
tensorflow 2.0;
## Description
EAFNet is a semantic segmentation (SS) model which is designed for the multimodal sensor fusion.
We utilize polarization information as the complementary information to improve SS's performance on certain categories with high polarization feature like glass and car.
We will upload the code when our paper is accepted. (Polarization-driven Semantic Segmentation via Efficient Attention-bridged Fusion)
